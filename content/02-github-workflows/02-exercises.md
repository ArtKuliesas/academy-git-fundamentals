# Exercises: GitHub Workflows

1. Make a new branch called feature/your_name
1. Add a new file called <your_name>.txt to the jokes/ folder
1. Add your favorite joke into the new files
1. Add and commit your changes locally
1. Push your changes using from your new branch to the remote
1. Open a Pull Request and assign someone to review your changes

## 2. Pushing and Pulling equilibrium

1. Navigate to the main branch
1. Check the exercises folder… is the folder ___ there?
1. Do a git pull (or git fetch + git merge) to pull the changes from remote into your local branch
1. Add a commit message that explains the action you are doing
