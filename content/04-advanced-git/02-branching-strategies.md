# Branching and Merging Strategies

In Git, there are several branching and merging strategies to help manage your codebase. The choice of strategy depends on the team's preferences, project requirements, and desired commit history.

## Feature Branch Workflow

- Create a new branch for each feature or bugfix
- Keep the master branch clean and stable
- Merge feature branches into the master branch after completion and testing

## Gitflow Workflow

- Master branch represents the production-ready state
- Develop branch serves as an integration branch for features
- Feature branches are created from the develop branch and merged back into it
- Release branches are created from the develop branch for final testing and bugfixes before merging into master
- Hotfix branches are created from the master branch for critical bugfixes and merged back into both master and develop

## Forking Workflow

- Each developer forks the main repository and works on their fork
- Changes are submitted through pull requests
- Maintainers review and merge pull requests into the main repository

## Centralized Workflow

- All developers work on a single shared repository
- Changes are pushed directly to the master branch or feature branches
- Less suitable for large teams or projects due to increased chances of conflicts
