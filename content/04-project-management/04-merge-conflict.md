# Chapter I - Pride and Prejudice and Zombies

IT IS A TRUTH universally acknowledged that a zombie in possession of brains must be in want of more brains. 

Never was this truth more plain than during the recent attacks at Netherfield Park, in which a household of eighteen was slaughtered and consumed by a horde of the living dead.

“My dear Mr. Bennet,” said his lady to him one day, “have you
heard that Netherfield Park is occupied again?”

Mr. Bennet replied that he had not and went about his morning
business of dagger sharpening and musket polishing—for attacks by the unmentionables had grown alarmingly frequent in recent weeks.

“But it is,” returned she. Mr. Bennet made no answer.

“Do you not want to know who has taken it?” cried his wife
impatiently.

“Woman, I am attending to my musket. Prattle on if you must, but leave me to the defense of my estate!”

This was invitation enough.

“Why, my dear, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune; that he escaped London in a chaise and four just as the strange plague broke through the Manchester line.”

“What is his name?” asked Mr Bennet.

“Bingley. A single man of four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!”
